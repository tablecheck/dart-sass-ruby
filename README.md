# Dart Sass for Ruby

**Notice: This gem is deprecated and no longer maintained.** Please use [sassc-embedded-shim-ruby](https://github.com/sass-contrib/sassc-embedded-shim-ruby). Note sassc-embedded-shim-ruby is a misnomer, it actually provides Dart Sass functionality.

[![gem](https://badge.fury.io/rb/dartsass-ruby.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/dartsass-ruby)

Use [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) with Ruby.

This gem is a fork of [sass/sassc-ruby](https://github.com/sass/sassc-ruby).
It is a compatibility shim which attempts to replicate SassC functionality
on Dart Sass, providing an easy upgrade path. Under-the-hood, this gem delegates to the
[sass-embedded gem](https://github.com/ntkme/sass-embedded-host-ruby)
which provides native binaries for Dart Sass instead of SassC (libsass).

**Important:** When Dart Sass 2.0 is released, this gem will be sunset
and relevant code will be migrated to [dartsass-sprockets](https://github.com/tablecheck/dartsass-sprockets).
Please see [this issue](https://github.com/tablecheck/dartsass-sprockets/issues/2) for details.

For ease of upgrading, the root namespace `::SassC` is still used by this gem,
although it is now a misnomer.

## Installation

Rails/Sprockets users are recommended to use [dartsass-sprockets](https://github.com/tablecheck/dartsass-sprockets)
instead of this gem directly. In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dartsass-sprockets'
```

### Upgrading to Dart Sass

This gem is a drop-in replacement to [sassc-ruby](https://github.com/sass/sassc-ruby).
Note the following differences:

1. Option `style: :nested` and `style: :compact` behave as `style: :expanded`. Use `style: :compressed` for minification.
2. Option `:precision` is ignored, as Dart Sass sets it to a sufficiently high value.
3. Option `:line_comments` is ignored and will always be disabled.
4. `Sass2Scss` functionality has been removed.

See [the dart-sass documentation](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass#behavioral-differences-from-ruby-sass) for other differences.

## Usage

This library utilizes [dart-sass](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass) to compile
SCSS or SASS syntax to CSS. To compile, use a `SassC::Engine`, e.g.:

```ruby
SassC::Engine.new(".klass1, .klass2 { color: :red; }", style: :compressed).render
```

## Alternatives

* [dartsass-rails](https://github.com/rails/dartsass-rails): The Rails organization
  maintains its own wrapper for Dart Sass. Unlike this gem, dartsass-rails does
  not support Sprockets.
